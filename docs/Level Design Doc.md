## constraints
- movement speed
- reload duration
- the further downwards the player is, the safer they are
- reloading continuously or parrying are the fastest ways to reload
- standing directly in front of an enemy means the player can unload their entire bullets on them
## enemies
bandit
- small
- when grouped, good for moving the player to a specific location

dog
- small
- takes the player by surprise
- the player needs to save 1 ammo to defeat this
- can be used to guide the player from one place to another

sumo
- big
- the player needs to save 3 ammo
- provides full screen pressure, but the player is safest below because the enemy will come to them quickly

kennel
- big
- spawns dogs, therefore requiring similar strategies
- the closer to the top of the screen, the more damage they can do to the kennel, since that's where they always are

small enemies are used for extra pressure while fighting a larger enemy
