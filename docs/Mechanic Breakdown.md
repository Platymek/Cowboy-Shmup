# Intended Experience
- a shmup which favours strategy
- high commitment, punishing but fair
- forced risk taking and near impossible to perfect play

the pc, player character can only shoot forward and walk slowly, with limited ammo and a committal reload system. A constant battle between stopping enemies from getting behind you, where they cannot be killed but remain a threat, and returning ammo. However, reloading can be used as a parry to weaker bullets which randomly occur, so make sure to remain opportunistic!
